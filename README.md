# SPAN - Stochastic Protocol ANalyzer

SPAN is a formal verification engine for model checking indistinguishability (trace equivalence) and state-based safety properties of randomized security protocols in the symbolic model.  

Information regarding threat model and the process calculus can be found in the following papers:
